## FINAL DELIVERABLES

**Objective: Cluster the Citi Bike stations by using common features and find certain pattern. The result could be used for the future citibike  station prediction.**

Observations:
We used the trip duration information to estimate the unique characters for the different clusters. By comparing the mean trip duration for each cluster, we can identify that:
- Cluster 0, 2 and 5 have longer average trip duration compared to other three clusters. Cluster 0 shows more 'start' trips in the morning and more ‘end’ trips in the afternoon. This corresponds to the mixed-used surrounding area near the subway that receives bikes in the morning.
- Cluster 1 showed much more start trips than end trips in the morning and more end trips than start trips in the afternoon. This is a residential area away from the subway station where people take bikes in the morning and commute back in the afternoon.
-	Cluster 2  shows much more 'start' trips than ‘end’ in the morning and more 'end' than 'start' in the afternoon. Again, this is a residential area far away from the subway station where people need to commute extensively by bike.
- Cluster 3 'end' trips number are much larger than 'start' trips number in the morning but similar to it in the afternoon - a commercial area near a subway station.
-	Cluster 4 stations are similar to cluster 3 with the difference that there is a different empty station pattern at night. Empty at night would mean that these bikes were ridden at the end of the day, to commute to the subway.
-	Cluster 5 stations are similar to cluster 3 and 4 with the difference that it is not empty during the day, so probably there is a commercial area.
